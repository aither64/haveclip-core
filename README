HaveClip - a simple clipboard management tool
=============================================

Have you ever grown tired of thinking how to transfer a link or a text from one
computer to another? Will you email yourself, use 3rd party service like
pastebin, or will you copy it by hand?

HaveClip may be the solution. Ctrl+C on one computer, Ctrl+V on another. Simple.

Main features are:
 - synchronize clipboard on multiple devices
 - save clipboard history, easily get overwritten data

Clipboard is instantly synchronized across all your devices. It can handle all
forms of text and images.

HaveClip is multiplatform. Copy a file in one OS, paste in another.
Supports Windows, Linux and Mac OS X. Client for Android is planned.
It should also be possible to create client for iOS and other mobile OSes.

So far it is not possible to copy files over network with HaveClip. I would
like to implement it though.

Build
-----
  # tar -xzf HaveClip-0.1.0-src.tar.gz
  # cd HaveClip-0.1.0-src
  # qmake
  # make

Installation
------------
You can either copy it to /usr/local/bin

  # cp HaveClip /usr/local/bin/

or wherever you want.

Run with

  # ./HaveClip

Usage
-----
Launch it. First thing you want to do is to setup devices, where the clipboard
will be synced. Right click on the tray icon and select Settings. Go to tab Pool
and add IP addresses of your devices. The format for each entry is
IP address:port. For example:

  1.2.3.4:9999

Now when you copy something into clipboard, it will be sent to all devices
listed in Pool.

It is also not recommended to use HaveClip over slow or paid network connections,
since it can transfer a lot of data. For instance, image copied from GIMP
is saved to clipboard in multiple formats, so the size can exceed a few tens of MB.

License
-------
HaveClip is released under GNU/GPL.

WARNING
-------
Currently, there is *no* security in place. Contents of clipboard are sent
in plaintext. It is meant for home and personal use only. Definitely do not use
it unsecured over the Internet!

However, I plan to implement SSL and some passwords, so no one would be able
to easily inject something in your clipboard.
