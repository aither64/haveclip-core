HaveClip - a simple clipboard management tool
=============================================

Have you ever grown tired of thinking how to transfer a link or a text from one
computer to another? Will you email yourself, use 3rd party service like
pastebin, or will you copy it by hand?

HaveClip may be the solution. Ctrl+C on one computer, Ctrl+V on another. Simple.

Main features are:
 - synchronize clipboard on multiple devices
 - save clipboard history, easily get overwritten data

Clipboard is instantly synchronized across all your devices. It can handle all
forms of text and images.

HaveClip is multiplatform. Copy a file in one OS, paste in another.
Supports Windows, Linux and Mac OS X. Client for Android is planned.
It should also be possible to create client for iOS and other mobile OSes.

So far it is not possible to copy files over network with HaveClip. I would
like to implement it though.

Requirements
------------
HaveClip for desktop is written in C++ using the Qt framework.

 - Qt at least 4.7, it might for with older versions, but it's not tested
   - modules core, gui, network and xml

Build
-----
  # tar -xzf HaveClip-0.1.0-src.tar.gz
  # cd HaveClip-0.1.0-src
  # qmake
  # make

Installation
------------
You can either copy it to /usr/local/bin

  # cp HaveClip /usr/local/bin/

or wherever you want.

Run with

  # ./HaveClip

Usage
-----
First thing you want to do is to setup devices, where the clipboard will be
synced. Right click on the tray icon and select Settings. Go to tab Pool
and add IP addresses of your devices. The format for each entry is
IP address:port. For example:

  1.2.3.4:9999

Now when you copy something into clipboard, it will be sent to all devices
listed in Pool.

It is not recommended to use HaveClip over slow or paid network connections,
since it can transfer a lot of data. For instance, image copied from GIMP
is saved to clipboard in multiple formats, so the size can exceed a few tens of MB.

Features
--------
Where as the main functionality (clipboard syncing) is present on all platforms,
not all other features are. The most equipped is the Linux version. It can
show you a preview of clipboard contents in tooltip on tray icon. This is not
possible to easily implement on other platforms.

In Linux, when you copy something and then close the application, the copied data
is lost. HaveClip prevents that. If the clipboard contents suddenly disappears,
it will be reset.

For planned features see TODO.

License
-------
HaveClip is released under GNU/GPL.

WARNING
-------
Currently, there is *no* security in place. Contents of clipboard are sent
in plaintext. It is meant for home and personal use only. Definitely do not use
it unsecured over the Internet or public network!

However, I plan to implement SSL and some password mechanism, so no one would be
able to easily inject something in your clipboard.
