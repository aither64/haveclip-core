- Solve the queueing problem in sync - currently, there may be more one
  connection from one sender to one receiver. For example, when the user copies
  something big that takes time to transfer and subsequently copies something
  small. Now there are two transfers running with an uncertain result. The last
  to finish will always override the clipboard content on the receiver.
  Possible solutions:
    - abort the previos transfer
    - implement queueing

* Long-term wishlist
- Relay server
- Copy files using FUSE
